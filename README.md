# Paper Puppets

*A lab report by Ryan Curtis*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, clone [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab4). You'll need to describe your design, include a video of your paper display in operation, and upload any code you wrote to make it move.

## Part A. Actuating DC motors

**Link to a video of your virbation motor**

## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**
The red wire goes to power.
The orange wire goes to the signal.
The brown wire goes to ground.

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**
The signal line should attache to pin 9.

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**
The angle corresponds the incrementor in each for loop.
The speed corresponds the delay in the loop.

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**
